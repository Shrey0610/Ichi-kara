# Ichi-kara
``` Learn anything, from first principles.```

- 'ichi-kara' is a personal learning platform that curates high-quality knowledge from across the internet and transforms it into structured, beginner-friendly learning experiences.

- Given a topic, the system discovers relevant educational content, extracts the core ideas, and presents them in two complementary formats:

1. Original readable content — clean, distraction-free versions of source material with proper attribution.

2. AI-generated explanations — simplified, structured interpretations designed to help learners understand concepts from first principles.

- The goal of ichi-kara is not just to summarize information, but to support deep understanding across domains — programming, data science, design, humanities, or any subject the learner wants to explore.

- The project is built as a modular system combining web crawling, content extraction, natural language processing, and AI-assisted explanation, with a focus on usability and human-centered learning design.

- This repository documents the ongoing development of ichi-kara as both:

    > a practical learning tool for everyday use, and

    > an applied exploration of Python, AI systems, and human–computer interaction.
